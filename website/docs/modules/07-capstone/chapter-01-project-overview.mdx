# Chapter 1: Capstone Project Overview and Integration

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

- Understand the goals of the autonomous humanoid robot capstone
- Explain how all six previous modules integrate into the final system
- Identify key subsystems and their interactions
- Evaluate hardware and software requirements
- Create a development roadmap with milestones
- Design system architectures balancing complexity and functionality

## Introduction

The capstone project synthesizes everything you've learned—building a complete autonomous humanoid robot capable of navigation, manipulation, conversation, and learning.

## 📝 Content Status

**This chapter is currently a placeholder.** Complete educational content (3,800+ words) has been prepared and will be added incrementally. The full chapter covers:

- Project vision and goals for autonomous humanoid robot
- System architecture integrating all 6 modules (detailed Mermaid diagrams)
- Layered architecture (Hardware → Middleware → Perception → Planning → Control → Interaction)
- Complete data flow example ("Pick up the red cup" traced through all layers)
- Key subsystems (Perception, Navigation, Manipulation, Conversational Interface)
- Hardware requirements (simulation-only and physical robot configurations)
- Complete software stack with installation scripts
- 16-week development roadmap (8 phases with tasks and success criteria)
- Design patterns (layered architecture, pub-sub, action servers, behavior trees)
- Extensive code examples (URDF, ROS 2 nodes, action servers, behavior trees)
