# Module 7: Capstone - Autonomous Humanoid Robot

## Overview

The capstone project brings together everything you've learned across all modules to build a fully autonomous humanoid robot. You'll integrate perception, planning, control, and interaction to create a robot that can navigate environments, manipulate objects, and interact with humans.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Design end-to-end autonomous robot systems
- Integrate multiple subsystems (vision, language, planning, control)
- Implement complete robot autonomy pipelines
- Debug complex multi-component robotic systems
- Deploy and test autonomous behaviors in simulation
- Understand the full lifecycle of robotic system development

## Module Structure

### Chapter 1: Capstone Project Overview
Understand the scope of the autonomous humanoid robot project and plan your implementation approach.

### Chapter 2: Step-by-Step Implementation Guide
Follow detailed instructions to build each component of your autonomous humanoid, with checkpoints and validation steps.

### Chapter 3: Deployment and Testing
Deploy your complete system, run comprehensive tests, troubleshoot issues, and validate autonomous behaviors.

## Prerequisites

- **REQUIRED**: Completion of Modules 1-6
- Strong understanding of ROS 2, simulation, VLA, and conversational AI
- Comfort with integrating multiple software components
- Debugging skills for complex systems

## Project Scope

Your autonomous humanoid robot will demonstrate:

1. **Autonomous Navigation**: Navigate cluttered environments using SLAM and path planning
2. **Object Manipulation**: Pick and place objects using vision-guided grasping
3. **Natural Interaction**: Understand voice commands and respond appropriately
4. **Task Execution**: Complete multi-step tasks autonomously (e.g., "Bring me the red cup from the kitchen")

## Estimated Time

**15-20 hours** to complete the full capstone project
