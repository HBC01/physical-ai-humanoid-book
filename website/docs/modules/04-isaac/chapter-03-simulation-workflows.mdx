# Chapter 3: Simulation Workflows and Best Practices

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

- Design effective simulation workflows for robot development
- Generate synthetic training data at scale
- Implement domain randomization in Isaac Sim
- Optimize performance for CPU and GPU systems
- Export models to production formats (ONNX, TensorRT)

## Introduction

This chapter explores production workflows for using Isaac Sim in robot development—from training data generation to deployment optimization.
