# Module 4: NVIDIA Isaac Sim & Isaac ROS

## Overview

NVIDIA Isaac Sim is a GPU-accelerated simulation platform designed for robotics AI development. This module teaches you how to leverage Isaac Sim's photorealistic rendering, accurate physics, and deep integration with AI frameworks.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Install and configure NVIDIA Isaac Sim (CPU and GPU modes)
- Create realistic robot simulations with accurate physics
- Integrate Isaac Sim with ROS 2 using Isaac ROS
- Leverage GPU acceleration for perception and planning
- Understand sim-to-real transfer techniques specific to Isaac
- Choose between CPU-compatible and GPU-accelerated workflows

## Module Structure

### Chapter 1: Isaac Sim Introduction
Get started with Isaac Sim, understand GPU vs CPU modes, and set up your first simulation.

### Chapter 2: Isaac ROS Integration
Learn how Isaac ROS bridges NVIDIA's simulation platform with the ROS 2 ecosystem.

### Chapter 3: Advanced Simulation Workflows
Master GPU-accelerated sensor simulation, synthetic data generation, and domain randomization.
