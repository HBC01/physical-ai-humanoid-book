# Chapter 2: Unity for Robotics Simulation

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

- Set up Unity Robotics Hub for ROS 2 integration
- Import URDF models into Unity environments
- Create photorealistic training environments
- Implement sensor simulation using Unity's rendering pipeline
- Build ROS-Unity communication bridges

## Introduction

Unity game engine offers complementary strengths to Gazebo—photorealistic rendering, mature asset ecosystem, and powerful visual scripting—making it ideal for certain robotics applications.
