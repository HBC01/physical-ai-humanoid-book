# Chapter 1: Introduction to Gazebo Simulation

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

- Understand what Gazebo is and why simulation is critical for robotics
- Install and configure Gazebo for robot simulation
- Create custom worlds with physics and environmental elements
- Work with URDF and SDF robot description formats
- Simulate sensors (cameras, LIDAR, IMU) realistically
- Integrate Gazebo with ROS 2

## Introduction

Simulation is essential for robotics development—enabling safe, fast, cost-effective testing before deploying to physical hardware.
