# Module 3: Gazebo & Unity - Digital Twin

## Overview

Simulation environments are essential for testing robots safely and cost-effectively. This module covers two powerful simulation platforms: Gazebo (open-source, ROS-integrated) and Unity (game engine for realistic physics and graphics).

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Set up Gazebo simulation environment
- Create robot models using URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)
- Spawn and control robots in Gazebo worlds
- Integrate Unity with robotics workflows
- Understand the concept of digital twins for robot development
- Choose the right simulation tool for your use case

## Module Structure

### Chapter 1: Gazebo Introduction
Install Gazebo, understand its architecture, and create your first simulated robot environment.

### Chapter 2: Unity for Robotics
Learn how Unity's powerful physics engine and graphics can accelerate robot development.

### Chapter 3: Digital Twins - Simulation to Reality
Explore strategies for transferring robot behaviors from simulation to physical hardware (sim-to-real).

## Prerequisites

- Completion of Modules 1-2
- ROS 2 basics (publishers, subscribers, nodes)
- Basic understanding of 3D coordinate systems

## Estimated Time

**6-8 hours** to complete all chapters and exercises
