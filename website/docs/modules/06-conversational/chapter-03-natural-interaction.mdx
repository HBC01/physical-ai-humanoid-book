# Chapter 3: Natural Human-Robot Interaction

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

- Design multimodal interaction systems (speech + gesture + gaze)
- Apply social robotics principles for natural interaction
- Implement turn-taking and proxemics
- Follow HRI UX best practices
- Consider accessibility requirements in robot design

## Introduction

Natural interaction goes beyond speech—incorporating gestures, spatial behavior, social cues, and accessibility to create robots people enjoy working with.
