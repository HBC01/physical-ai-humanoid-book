# Chapter 2: Speech Recognition and Synthesis

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

- Implement ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) systems
- Configure TTS (Text-to-Speech) for natural robot voices
- Handle real-time audio processing and streaming
- Deal with noise and environmental challenges
- Integrate wake word detection for always-listening systems

## Introduction

Speech I/O enables natural voice-based interaction—essential for conversational robots operating in human environments.
