# Module 6: Conversational Robotics

## Overview

Conversational robotics enables natural human-robot interaction through speech and dialogue. This module covers speech recognition, dialogue management, natural language generation, and conversational UX patterns for robots.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Implement speech recognition systems for robots
- Build dialogue management systems for multi-turn conversations
- Generate natural language responses
- Design conversational UX patterns for robot interactions
- Handle interruptions, clarifications, and context in robot conversations
- Integrate text-to-speech and speech-to-text libraries

## Module Structure

### Chapter 1: Dialog Systems for Robots
Learn the fundamentals of dialogue management and conversational AI architectures.

### Chapter 2: Speech Recognition and Synthesis
Implement robust speech-to-text and text-to-speech systems using modern libraries.

### Chapter 3: Natural Human-Robot Interaction
Design conversational experiences that feel natural, including handling errors, interruptions, and context switching.
