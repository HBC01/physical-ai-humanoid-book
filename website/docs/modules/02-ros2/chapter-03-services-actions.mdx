# Chapter 3: Services and Actions

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

- Implement ROS 2 services for request-response communication
- Create action servers for long-running tasks with feedback
- Choose between topics, services, and actions appropriately
- Handle timeouts, errors, and edge cases gracefully

## Introduction

While topics excel at continuous data streams, many robot behaviors require request-response or goal-oriented patterns. This chapter introduces services and actions—two additional communication paradigms in ROS 2.
