# Module 2: ROS 2 - Robotic Nervous System

## Overview

ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) is the industry-standard middleware for building modular, distributed robotic systems. This module teaches you how to architect robot software using nodes, topics, services, and actions.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Install and configure ROS 2 on Ubuntu or WSL2
- Create ROS 2 nodes that communicate via topics
- Implement request-response patterns using services
- Coordinate long-running tasks with actions
- Design modular robot architectures using ROS 2 principles
- Debug ROS 2 systems using command-line tools

## Module Structure

### Chapter 1: ROS 2 Introduction
Get started with ROS 2, understand its architecture, and set up your development environment.

### Chapter 2: Nodes, Topics, and Publishers/Subscribers
Learn the core communication patterns for distributed robotic systems.

### Chapter 3: Services and Actions
Implement synchronous request-response (services) and asynchronous goal-based tasks (actions).

## Prerequisites

- Completion of Module 1 (Foundations)
- Ubuntu 22.04, WSL2, or access to Linux environment
- Python 3.10+

## Estimated Time

**5-7 hours** to complete all chapters and exercises
