# Chapter 2: Nodes and Topics in Depth

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

- Master advanced node communication patterns in ROS 2
- Configure Quality of Service (QoS) settings for different data types
- Create custom message types for specialized applications
- Debug topic communication issues effectively
- Optimize node design for performance and reliability

## Introduction

This chapter explores advanced ROS 2 communication concepts, building on the fundamentals from Chapter 1. We'll dive deep into topics, messages, and Quality of Service—the core mechanisms that enable robust robot software.

## Quality of Service (QoS) Profiles

ROS 2 uses DDS (Data Distribution Service) which supports configurable QoS settings...
