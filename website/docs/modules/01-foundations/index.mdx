# Module 1: Foundations of Physical AI & Embodied Intelligence

## Overview

This foundational module introduces the core concepts of Physical AI and embodied intelligence. You'll learn how robots perceive the physical world, process sensory information, and make decisions in real-time environments.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Explain the key differences between traditional AI and Physical AI
- Understand the concept of embodied intelligence and sensorimotor coupling
- Describe how robots represent and interact with physical spaces
- Identify the challenges unique to physical robot systems (sensor noise, actuator dynamics, real-time constraints)
- Apply foundational concepts to simple robotic scenarios

## Module Structure

### Chapter 1: Introduction to Physical AI
Learn what Physical AI is, why it matters, and how it differs from software-only AI systems.

### Chapter 2: Embodied Intelligence
Explore the theory of embodiment - how having a physical body shapes intelligence and learning.

### Chapter 3: Physical Systems & Constraints
Understand the real-world constraints that shape robotic system design (physics, sensors, actuators, computation).

## Prerequisites

- Basic programming knowledge (Python recommended)
- High school level physics (mechanics, forces, motion)
- Curiosity about robots and AI!

## Estimated Time

**3-5 hours** to complete all chapters and exercises
