# Chapter 1: Introduction to Vision-Language-Action Models

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

- Define VLA models and explain their significance for robotics
- Understand how vision, language, and action modalities integrate
- Recognize advantages of VLAs over traditional approaches
- Identify key VLA architectures (RT-1, RT-2, PaLM-E)
- Implement basic VLA concepts using pre-trained models

## Introduction

Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models represent a paradigm shift—unifying perception, understanding, and control in a single end-to-end learned system.
