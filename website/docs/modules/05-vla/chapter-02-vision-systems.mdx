# Chapter 2: Vision Systems for Robots

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

- Understand camera types and their applications in robotics
- Implement computer vision fundamentals with OpenCV
- Build object detection pipelines for robot perception
- Estimate depth and perform 3D reconstruction
- Apply vision systems to robot navigation and manipulation

## Introduction

Vision is a robot's primary sense. This chapter explores how robots perceive the visual world through cameras and computer vision algorithms.
