# Chapter 3: Language Grounding and Instruction Following

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

- Understand language grounding in robotic contexts
- Parse natural language instructions into robot actions
- Implement semantic understanding for spatial relationships
- Integrate LLMs with robot control systems
- Handle ambiguity and uncertainty in language commands

## Introduction

Language grounding connects abstract linguistic concepts to physical perceptions and actions—enabling robots to understand and execute natural language commands.
