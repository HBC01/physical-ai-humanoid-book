# Module 5: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

## Overview

Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models represent the frontier of multimodal robot intelligence. This module teaches you how to integrate computer vision, natural language understanding, and action planning to create robots that can understand visual scenes, interpret language commands, and execute appropriate actions.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Implement vision systems for object detection and scene understanding
- Integrate language models for natural instruction following
- Ground language commands to robot actions
- Build VLA pipelines that connect perception to action
- Understand multimodal learning approaches
- Apply VLA concepts to real robotic tasks

## Module Structure

### Chapter 1: VLA Introduction
Understand the VLA paradigm and how vision, language, and action work together for robot intelligence.

### Chapter 2: Vision Systems for Robots
Implement computer vision pipelines using OpenCV, deep learning models for object detection, and scene segmentation.

### Chapter 3: Language Grounding to Actions
Learn how to map natural language instructions to executable robot actions and trajectories.

## Prerequisites

- Completion of Modules 1-4
- Basic understanding of machine learning concepts
- Python libraries: OpenCV, PyTorch or TensorFlow basics

## Estimated Time

**8-10 hours** to complete all chapters and exercises
