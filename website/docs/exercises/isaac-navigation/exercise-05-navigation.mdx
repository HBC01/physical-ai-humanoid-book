# Exercise 5: Robot Navigation in Isaac Sim

## Prerequisites
- Isaac Sim 2023.1.1 or newer
- ROS 2 Humble bridge installed

## Setup Isaac Sim

```bash
# Launch Isaac Sim
./isaac-sim.sh

# In Isaac Sim: Load warehouse environment
# File → Open → Isaac/Environments/Simple_Warehouse
```

## ROS 2 Bridge Configuration

```python
# In Isaac Sim Python console
import omni.isaac.core.utils.extensions as extensions_utils
extensions_utils.enable_extension("omni.isaac.ros2_bridge")

# Configure ROS 2 topics
from omni.isaac.ros2_bridge import create_publisher
create_publisher("/cmd_vel", "geometry_msgs/Twist")
```

## Navigate Robot

```bash
# Terminal 1: Launch Isaac Sim with ROS 2

# Terminal 2: Send navigation commands
ros2 topic pub /cmd_vel geometry_msgs/msg/Twist \
  "{linear: {x: 0.5}, angular: {z: 0.0}}"
```

## Expected Behavior
- Robot moves forward at 0.5 m/s
- Visualized in Isaac Sim viewport
- Sensor data published to ROS 2 topics

## CPU vs GPU Performance
- GPU: Real-time ray tracing, 60+ FPS
- CPU: Reduced quality, 10-20 FPS (still functional)
