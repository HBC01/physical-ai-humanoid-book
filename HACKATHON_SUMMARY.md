## 🎬 Demo Day Workflow

### 30 Minutes Before
1. Open terminal
2. `cd /root/home/physical-ai-humanoid-book`
3. `npm install` (verify dependencies)
4. `npm run build` (create backup production build)

### 5 Minutes Before
1. `npm start`
2. Wait for success message
3. Open browser: `http://localhost:3000/physical-ai-humanoid-book/`
4. Open **DEMO_SCRIPT.md** on second monitor

### During Demo (90 seconds)
1. **[0:00-0:15]** Opening hook + show homepage
2. **[0:15-0:45]** Core features (curriculum, bilingual, developer experience)
3. **[0:45-1:15]** Technical deep dive (architecture, impact)
4. **[1:15-1:30]** Closing & call to action

### After Demo (Q&A)
- Use **JUDGE_PITCH.md** for talking points
- Emphasize: problem-solution fit, technical quality, global impact
- Show code quality if asked (TypeScript, React, modular)
